        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Fill a large pot with 5 cups of water. Stir in 1 teaspoon sea salt and bring to a boil.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add the lobster tails, cover with lid and let boil for 5 minutes, or until bright red.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Remove lobster tails, reserving the liquid stock. When the lobsters have cooled slightly, remove the meat from the shells, reserving the meat and any liquid that comes out of the shells.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Return lobster shells back to the water in the pot. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low and let simmer for a further 15 minutes to draw as much flavour out of the shells as possible.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> While stock is simmering, chop the meat into bite-sized pieces and refrigerate.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Heat butter and oil in a large, heavy-based pot over medium heat, Sweat the onions, carrots, celery and fresh herbs. Cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Season with the bouillon powder, salt and pepper/s. Stir in 4 cloves of minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Mix in tomato paste, cook for a further minute to coat vegetables. Sprinkle over flour and cook, while stirring occasionally for a further 2 minutes.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Pour in wine, simmer and let reduce to half. Stir in lobster stock, reduce heat and gently simmer while stirring occasionally, until liquid has thickened slightly and flavours have blended, about 30 minutes.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Take off the heat, transfer mixture to a blender and blend until smooth. Alternatively, purée with an immersion blender until very smooth. Return to medium-low heat and stir in heavy cream.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Melt butter a skillet pan over medium heat. Sauté garlic for 30 seconds, until fragrant. Add in chopped lobster meat, season with salt, pepper and cayenne to taste. Lightly sauté for 1 minute while stirring occasionally, until lobster meat is just warmed through.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Mix 3/4 of the lobster meat into the bisque. Pour into individual serving bowls. Top each bowl with remaining lobster meat and extra tarragon.

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium-low heat. In a bowl, mix together dry ingredients. Beat eggs into 1 1/2 cups milk, then stir in 2 tablespoons melted cooled butter, if using it. Gently stir this mixture into dry ingredients, mixing only enough to moisten flour; don't worry about a few lumps. If batter seems thick, add a little more milk.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Place a teaspoon or 2 of butter or oil on griddle or skillet. When butter foam subsides or oil shimmers, ladle batter onto griddle or skillet, making pancakes of any size you like. Adjust heat as necessary; usually, first batch will require higher heat than subsequent batches. Flip pancakes after bubbles rise to surface and bottoms brown, after 2 to 4 minutes.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Cook until second side is lightly browned. Serve, or hold on an ovenproof plate in a 200-degree oven for up to 15 minutes.

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, peppercorns, bay leaves and brown sugar. Add the chicken and toss to coat. Cover the bowl and place it in the refrigerator for at least one hour, and up to three.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> In a large skillet over medium-high heat, warm the canola oil until glistening. Add the chicken (letting as much marinade drip off as possible) to the pan. Brown the chicken thighs on both sides, about 6 minutes total.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add the remaining marinade to the skillet and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium or medium low to maintain a heavy simmer for 10 minutes. Flip the chicken thighs. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has reduced by half and is beginning to thicken, about 10 more minutes. When the chicken thigh reads 165°F on an instant-read thermometer, remove from the heat.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Serve the chicken thighs over cooked rice, sprinkled with green onions.
